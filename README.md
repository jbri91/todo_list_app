# Summary
This project was a real challenge for me. I learned a lot from putting this application together. I worked a lot more with functions and how they work. I also learned about the order of writing code so that it fires at the right moment. I am looking forward to learning more so that I can come back to this and update it to be even better! 

The most challenging part about this project were the bugs that continued to appear because of the way I had set up eventListeners within eventListeners making it difficult for me to make changes without breaking the code every time. Because of this, I learned how to use gitHub better in order to create another branch to be able to break the code more comfortably.
